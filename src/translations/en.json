  "about.description": "Let me introduce myself. I am a Semi Senior Full Stack Developer with a strong passion for technology. I have amassed over two and a half years of experience in developing applications and websites using cutting-edge frameworks such as VueJS, ReactJS, and NuxtJS. My thirst for knowledge led me to take up a new challenge, and currently, I am working on developing Android native mobile apps in Kotlin.\n\nThroughout my journey, I've come to understand the importance of teamwork in achieving quality results and constant growth.\n\n I am currently employed at Navent, where I serve as a Full Stack Developer responsible for developing Android Native Mobile apps in Kotlin.\n\n My passion for programming ignited in 2019 when I started developing my own Android native apps in JAVA. After spending some time in the mobile app development world, I shifted my focus to web development, where I spent two years honing my skills in VueJS and NuxtJS. Apart from programming, I also enjoy working on graphic design in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, Figma, etc.\n\n As a Full Stack Developer, I bring to the table my excellent communication and active listening skills, a natural flair for teamwork, an eye for detail and critical thinking. \n\nIn my free time, I love to unwind by building my own projects, creating playlists, going to the gym, playing tennis & video games, and spending time with my friends.",
