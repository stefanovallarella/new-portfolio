  "about.description": "Allow me to introduce myself. I am a Semi Senior Full Stack Developer with a strong passion for technology. I have amassed over two and a half years of experience in developing applications and websites using cutting-edge frameworks such as VueJS, ReactJS, and NuxtJS. Currently, I am furthering my knowledge by working on Android native mobile apps in Kotlin.\n\n Throughout my career, I have learned that teamwork is essential in achieving quality learning and continuous improvement. My previous position at EducacionIT involved developing and maintaining the company's applications and products using VueJS, NuxtJS, JS, Typescript, Docker, and AWS. I also actively pursued new challenges that helped me enhance my back-end knowledge, such as building REST APIs in Node.js / Typescript / Sequelize.\n\n I am currently employed at Navent, where I serve as a Full Stack Developer responsible for developing Android Native Mobile apps in Kotlin.\n\n My programming journey began in 2019 when I developed my own Android native apps in JAVA. I then shifted my focus to web development, where I spent two years honing my skills in VueJS and NuxtJS.\n\n As a Full Stack Developer, I excel at critical thinking, problem-solving, communication and active listening, leadership, planning and time management, flexibility, and responsibility. My technical expertise includes Git, GitHub, Docker, Npm, Yarn, Webpack, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Figma, Miro, Trello, Scrum, and Scrumban.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy creating playlists, going to the gym, playing tennis, building personal projects, and spending time with friends.",
