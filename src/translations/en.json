  "about.description": "As a Semi Senior Full Stack Developer, I am committed to accessibility, efficiency, and attention to detail in everything I do. Since I was a child, I have always been passionate about technology :computer:. My professional journey began in 2019 when I developed my own native Android applications in JAVA. Since then, for over two and a half years, I have been honing my skills in developing applications and websites using modern frameworks such as VueJS, ReactJS, and NuxtJS.\n\nI had the opportunity to be part of end-to-end processes of high-traffic websites, where performance and accessibility were key :rocket: such as [EducacionIT](https://www.educacionit.com/) or [ISTEA](https://www.istea.edu.ar/).\n\nI am a firm believer that teamwork is essential to achieve quality learning and continuous improvement. Currently, I work at Navent developing native Android mobile applications in Kotlin, such as [Zonaprop](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zonaprop.android).\n\nIn addition to programming, I have also learned to apply UX/UI design principles :art: to create attractive and functional products that meet user needs.\n\nIn my free time :partly_sunny:, I love spending time building my own projects, creating playlists, working out, playing tennis & video games, spending time with friends, and pursuing my passion for [photography](https://www.instagram.com/stfvall/).",
